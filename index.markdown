  <p class="bio">
    I’m currently working as a software engineer at Meta, based in NYC 🗽, focused on Ads ML infrastructure and recommendation systems. I’m originally from Montreal, Canada, and graduated from the University of Waterloo with a degree in Computer Science before moving to the U.S. for work. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me practicing yoga 🧘‍♂️, searching for the best coffee in town ☕, or wandering around with a camera 📸.
